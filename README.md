- 👋 Hi, I’m @pakuttuva
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Ethical Hacking and Bug Bounty Tools
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tools used in Bug bounties and Ethical Hacking. And, I am also planning to learn to customize new similar tools for me. 
      I am collecting these repostories from fellow hackers for learning purposes. All credits for creating the collected repositories should go to its owner.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with fellow hackers for learning and partner with them in the projects
